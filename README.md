# Music_Advisor_IntelliJ_Academy
Program working with Spotify API.

Command Pattern has been implemented here to allow invoking the same command
but with different query arguments (to show 'next', 'prev' pages
of a given category).
Also - this project works with real Spotify (provided with Client Secret)
in opposite to the version from IntelliJ Academy which had implemented
invalid mock algorithm for paging requests.

I have also added an option to see our own 'liked' tracks library,
and save it to a txt file.
